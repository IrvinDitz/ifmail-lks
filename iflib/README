utlib is a collection of useful subroutines used in various programs.
Several modules are taken from INN 1.4 and are subject to INN's
copyright and distribution policy, others are allowed for free
distribution and use for any purpose. The INN's modules are: parsedate.c
gettime.c configdata.h libinn.h clibrary.h macros.h. In the other
programs, some ideas are taken from "RFmail" package. usleep()
implementation contributed by Gert Doering <gert@greenie.muc.de>,
signal() suitable for some BSD-ish systems contributed by Martin Junius
<mj@dfv.rwth-aachen.de>.

When compiling, specify:

cc ... -I${LIBDIR} ... ${LIBDIR}/utlib.a ...

Compiling utlib programs on some systems (as SCO and ISC) you will need 
to hack INN's "configdata.h" (and maybe "clibrary.h" too) accordingly.
Even better, if you have INN installed, just take these files from INN
source tree (*after* configuring).
