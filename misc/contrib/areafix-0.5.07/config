# The AreaFix's main config file

#
# Areafix mode: FTN or non-FTN
# 
# In FTN mode FTN links are allowed, non-FTN links can reference
# newsgroups gated to FIDO by their echotags, and the echotags
# are included in the lists generated by %LIST, %QUERY and %UNLINKED
# commands.
#
# In non-FTN mode all links are non-FTN, echotags appear nowhere
# and some configuration parameters are ignored (they marked as "FTN")
