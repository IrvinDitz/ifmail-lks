	Area Manager for ifgate+INN (areafix)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I. MISCELLANEOUS RUBBISH BY AUTHORS

Area Manager is a program that plays the role of the Areafix robot
of standard MS-DOS FTN packages in a system using ifgate and INN
for internet news and FidoNet echoes processing.
It handles links' requests for subscribing/unsubscribing to/from
echoes by translating echo names to newsgroup names using ifmail's
Areas file and modifying INN's newsfeeds file. Usual %LIST,
%QUERY, %UNLINKED, %PASSIVE and %ACTIVE commands are also recognized
and processed in a proper way.

II. INSTALLATION

To install areafix:

1) compile and link areaqueue.c. Read the comments in it.

2) add aliases for areafix and "areafix's name" (see 'config')
to your MTA config. Example for sendmail's /etc/aliases:

areafix: |/usr/lib/ifmail/areafix/areaqueue " " /var/spool/ifmail/areafix
areafix-service: sysop

We assume that areaqueue program resides in /usr/lib/ifmail/areafix,
request queue will is to be placed in /var/spool/ifmail/areafix and
replys to angry areafix's messages are to be forwarded to user "sysop"
of your system.

3) Edit 'config', 'restricted' and 'passwords'  files.
Read comments while editing.

4) Edit /etc/syslog.conf according to log facility chosen
Example:

local1.*		/var/log/ifmail/areafix

and create the log file if your syslogd wouldn't create it
(e.g. in BSDI 1.1).

5) Add a proper line to your crontab in ordrer to run areafix.pl
sometimes. Supply the full name of 'config' file as the 1st
parameter.
