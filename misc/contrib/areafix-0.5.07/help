   3. Areafix control/info commands

1) %HELP - get this message :)

2) %LIST - get the list of echoes present on our node

3) %WIDE - force areafix to send wide-format lists on %LIST, %QUERY
	   and %UNLINKED commands. It means that you will get not
	   only echo names and descriptions, but also corresponding
	   newsgroup names (useful for %+ and %- commands)

4) %QUERY - get your subscription list

5) %UNLINKED - get the list of echoes that youa are NOT subscribed to

6) %PASSIVE - make your subscription passive. It means that you will
	      receive no echoes until you send %ACTIVE command, but 
	      you do not loose your subscription list on our node

7) %ACTIVE - make your subscription active. You will get echoes again
