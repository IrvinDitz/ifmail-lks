# UNIX TICK-processor (u-tic) feed list
#
# The file consists of feed records.
# The first line of the record is feed's address. It must start
# at the beginning of a line.
# Other lines of the record are the feed's subscription list.
# They must have a space or tab as the first character.
# Each line contains one area name. The name may contain wildcard
# characters "*" and "?". If it starts with "!"  the name after "!"
# is used to exclude areas _from_the_list_above_the_name_, i.e.
# if there is a record
#
# 6:66/66.66
#	*
#	!*PIC*
#	PICSYSOP*
#	!PICSYSOP.NUDE
#
# 6:66/66.66 will be subscribed to all FEs except those which contain "PIC"
# in their name except PICSYSOP* that will be included in its subscription list,
# but PICSYSOP.NUDE will not.
