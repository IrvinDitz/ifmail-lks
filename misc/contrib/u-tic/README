IMPORTANT!!!

An u-attach.pl utility has been added.
When using u-tic at heavily loaded node u-tic hanged for many hours
waiting for .?LO having been unlocked because of it's manner of file processing.
Now u-tic.pl just links files to fileecho outbound directories,
and u-attach.pl then tries to attach the files to the downlink
each time it is started (and leaves the files if the node is locked
or the .?LO is locked)

How to install:
1. edit MAKE.CONFIG
2. run 'make world'
3. edit configuration files
4. add alias for filefix as |"<path>/queuemail <path to queue dir>"
   (don't forget that sendmail throws unquoted spaces away)
5. add u-fix.pl and u-tic.pl and u-attach.pl to fnet's crontab

What u-tic & u-fix can already do:
	- almost all that U wait from TICK processor and filefix :)
	- not to waste time by copying files - all file movement
	  and distribution is implemented with link(2)/rename(2);
	- to replace files with the same name and their TICKs both
	  in fileecho outbound directory and .flo;
	- to preserve comments between records in config files being
	  modified by u-fix

What it cannot yet do well:
	- to purge and clean it's filebase
