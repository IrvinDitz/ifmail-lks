 Conversion of areatags to newsgroups (with distribution) and back.

 Lines starting with a whitespace are comments.  This is because
 areatags may contain a hash ('#') character which would otherwise
 be sutable as a comment designator.

 AREATAG		newsgroup		distribution

SU.GENERAL		relcom.talk		fido7
REC.RADIO.SHORTWAVE	rec.radio.shortwave	world
PVT.SYSOP		general			local
ALT.FAN.TOLKIEN		alt.fan.tolkien		world
REC.ARTS.BOOKS.TOLKIEN	rec.arts.books.tolkien	world
RU.UNIX			fido7.unix		fido7
FIDO.ANYWHERE		fido7.fido-anywhere	fido7

 Line with a single '*' in the AREATAG field defines default newsgroup
 and distribution.  '*' in the "newsgroup" field, if present, is expanded
 to the original areatag (converted to lowcase).

*			junk.*			local

 Line with a single '*' in the "newsgroup" field defines default areatag.
 '*' in the AREATAG field, if present, is expanded to the original
 newsgroup (converted to uppercase).  (Distribution is irrelevant).

BAD.*			*

 You can specify a line with a single asterisk in the AREATAG field and
 a single asterisk in the "newsgroup" field.  It will cause a reversible
 conversion - areatag will be an uppercased newsgroup, and a newsgroup 
 will be a lowercased areatag.  This is not recommended (and therefore
 commented out in this example).
