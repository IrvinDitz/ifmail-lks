This is freeware.  Except for the modules taken the other packages,
(which may be subject to different distributing policy), you may use
this software for any purpose, commercial or noncommercial, including

The package consists of two major parts: ifgate (gateway programs,
analog of FidoNet tosser/packer), and ifcico (transport agent, analog of
FidoNet mailer), each in its own subdirectory.  Routines common to these
programs are in the iflib subdirectory.  In the top-level subdirectory
are: README (this file), CONFIG (your system configuration definition)
and top-level Makefile.  There is also a "misc" subdirectory with
examples of configuration, some useful scripts, FAQ list etc.

Each of the subdirectories (ifgate, ifcico, iflib and misc) contains its
own README file, refer to them for more technical details.

To install the package, edit the CONFIG file to match your configuration
and run "make" and (if you are satisfied) "make install".

There is a mailing list for ifmail-related discussions.  To subscribe,
send request to: <ifmail-request@online.ru> (this is a SmartList
program).  Just put a word `subscribe' into subject, message body is
irrelevant.  Likewise, to unsubscribe, send mail to
<ifmail-request@online.ru> with a word `unsubscribe' in the subject.
The HTML-ized archieve of the mailing list is available on the WWW
